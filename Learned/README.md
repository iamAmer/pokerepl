## strings.Fields()
- A function that is used to split a string into substrings based on whitespaces.
- Also removes the the leading and trailing white spaces and treat them as a single separator.

## reflect.DeepEqual
- It checks if two values are equal, but not just “==” equality.
- It goes deep into the values, looking at their contents, not just their references.
