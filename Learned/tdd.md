# TDD (Test Driven Development)
-Writing code that involves writing test cases that fails, then writing enough code to make the tests pass, Adding more test cases then refactoring code and repeating the process.

- Refactoring doesn't change the nature of the function, what changes is the implementation, performance, readable code... but the output is the same. 

- You can write all the production code before any single line of test cases or the opposite, but with TDD debugging time get less and less.

# BDD (Behavior Driven Development)
- Enhanced TDD
- Given,When And Then
    - Given the counter = 0, when i press the tick(), then increment the counter.
    - we don't depend on the implementation to evaluate our code.
- Testing the behavior not the implementation
